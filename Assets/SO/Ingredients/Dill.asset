  _description: 'Description: Dill serves as a soothing agent and helps to eliminate
    fungi and bacteria from the skin. It differs from fennel because it has a thinner
    stem base.  Precaution: It can make the skin very sensitive to the sun rays.
    It is therefore recommended to use sunscreen for the duration of the treatment. '
